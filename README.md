# Instructions for PySnippet GitHub organization

Welcome to PySnippet's official GitHub organization. This repository represents the instructions and rules of PySnippet.
Please read and follow the instructions and rules below.

## Contributing

We welcome and appreciate your contributions to any of PySnippet's projects! In order to ensure a positive experience
for all contributors, we have established the following contribution rules.

1. Long-term discussion and bug reports should be maintained through GitHub Issues. Discussions are also available in
   this venue.
2. Code review is done through GitHub Pull Requests, and contributors have to fork the repository they want to
   contribute to and create an issue branch.
3. Commit messages for all repositories should follow the following canonical format:
    - Start with `GH-` followed by the issue number (if the commit is related to an issue).
    - Be written in the present simple tense and describe the changes.
4. Pull-requests can only be reviewed and accepted by an organization member who is responsible for the particular
   project or has particular permissions given by repository maintainers.

All of the above rules can be overridden by the repository maintainers for a particular repository.
